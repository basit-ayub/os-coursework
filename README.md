## SCD Task Steps

1. **Bootstrapping the Project**  
   - Initialized Git repository.  
   - Staged `Lab Task/` and `Assignments/` directories.  
   - Made the initial commit and pushed to remote.

2. **First Major Edit**  
   - Edited assignment files to add the **question/comment header** on top of each file.  
   - Committed and pushed changes to `main`.

3. **A New Feature in the Works**  
   - Created a new branch `rmeBranch`.  
   - Added `README.md` as a new feature.  
   - Committed and pushed the branch.

4. **The Merge Challenge**  
   - Switched back to `main`.  
   - Merged `rmeBranch` into `main`.  
   - Pushed the final version.

5. **Keeping the Codebase Clean**  
   - Deleted branch `rmeBranch` locally and remotely to avoid clutter.

6. **Marking a Milestone**  
   - Added a temporary tag (e.g., `v1.0-labs`) to one of the lab files.  
   - Pushed the tag to remote.  
   - Later removed the tag locally and remotely as per task instructions.

## Notes

- All `.c` files and `.odt` documentation are properly organized under `labs/`.  
- Assignments are kept separately under `assignments/`.  
- Git history demonstrates clean commits, proper branching, merging, and tagging.  
- This repo can be cloned and navigated easily for review of each lab and assignment.
